                                        Founded by a clinician and a tech entrepreneur, Beam started in 2016 and is proud to have collaborated with leading kidney clinicians and professional bodies across the UK. Co-developed with Dr Sharlene Greenwood, Consultant Physiotherapist, we have created content with Kings College Hospital and the UK Kidney Research Consortium (UKKRC) Exercise and Lifestyle Clinical Study Group; and are piloting with Kidney Research UK with centres across the country. Beam is backed with research-led behaviour change interventions to help people become, and remain active.<br /><br />
                                    You may notice that Beam has a different feel to other health tech solutions (itâ€™s not so medicalised), this is because our platform has been developed to appeal to your patients (not you!). That being said, we have developed features with you at the forefront. <br /><br />
                                    Beam offers the opportunity for you to set up your own closed group on the platform, which you can invite your patients to join. In this group, you can host your own live, group classes; record and upload your classes to a private library; engage with your patients on a wall (they can use an alias to remain anonymous) and track activity levels and patient recorded outcome measures.<br /> <br />
                                    The cost for this service is GBP399/month with a minimum of a 3 month contract or GBP 2800/year (that's more than a 40% discount!). These are early bird rates as our clinic functionality is in development which means we are making it better for you and your patients.

                                        Having collaborated with Kidney Research UK we understand the immensely important role charities play and we would like to connect with kidney charities globally. <br /><br />
                                    We know that charities are often looking for ways to unite the community, improve access and equality in care, and improve physical and emotional welling. As such, we are always open to conversations and collaborations with other kidney charities.<br /><br />
                                    Ways we have supported charities in the past include building new content and sessions for their communities on Beam, hosting virtual exercise events for their community, and offering discounts on bulk purchase licenses.

                                    Normally a person with kidney disease would have to pay their own monthly subscription to Beam. Although the monthly fee is minimal considering the expert support they are receiving, cost can often be a barrier to patients. Should you wish to purchase licenses for all or some of your community, you can do so at a discounted rate.

                                        We are constantly looking for ways to better what we can offer the kidney community and the top way to do this is through content. If you would like to sponsor the creation of content (it can feature your product if you have one) or would like to sponsor a live class then please get in touch. We have different packages available that we'd like to talk through with you. Examples of partners we've worked with are Philips, with whom we created <a href="/detail/256/cystic-fibrosis" target="_blank">exercise videos for people on more advanced disease using a portable oxygen concentrator,</a> and <a href="/detail/150/cystic-fibrosis" target="_blank">Breas videos</a> featuring their latest non-invasive ventilator.  <br /><br />
			We're a dynamic company and always keen to find news ways to collaborate.  If you have an idea of how we could partner with you then please get in touch - we'd love to chat!
